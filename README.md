Arduino-103-C-Programming
=========================

In this level of the Arduino series we use the Arduino as a simple bridge to program the onboard AVR.

Tesla stuff.


## What you'll learn in this course:

You'll learn how to create a simple makefile for the AVR.

You'll learn how to directly program the Atmel Microcontroller in C.

You'll understand how the microcontroller actual works -- registers, clock frequency scaling.

You'll learn how to use the Arduino as a factory for programming microcontrollers.

Removing the training wheel -- your microcontroller projects will be limited only by your imagination


# Projects you'll create in this class:

because of the faster execution time, a host of RF projects becomes possible:

Wireless power transfer
-----------------------

Create a wirelessly powered LED, for which you can control the energy input from the arduino


Tesla Coil
----------
create a tesla coil using the arduino as an oscillator.


Underwater Robot Controller
-----------------------------

Learn to create pulse-per-minute trains and to control an Underwater Robot.

Introduction to Brushless Outrunner motors -- students will find this a good introductory
course for the Quadracopter Control Course.


The ATTiny
----------

Ever bothered by how much space your project took?  For many tasks the ATTiny is sufficient to accomplish the goal, as well as greatly reducing battery requirements, while maximizing embeddability.

Learn how to load a bootloader onto an ATTiny, and then program it to create smart embedded technology.
